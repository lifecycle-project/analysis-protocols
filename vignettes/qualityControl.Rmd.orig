# Quality control
The quality control measures are based upon the different variable types we have.
- non repeated
- yearly repeated
- monthly repeated
- trimester repeated
- weekly repeated

All of the measures are quakity control based upon generic algorithems and with the help of the [dsHelper](https://github.com/lifecycle-project/ds-helper) package.

## Usage
The quality control will be executed in the pipeline after uploading and importing the data into a DataSHIELD backend. However you can execute the flow seperatly as well.

```{r, execute the quality control separatly}
library(dsUpload)
du.quality.control(project = "lc_gecko_core_2_1", verbose = TRUE)
```

### Table types
For each of the types there is a different analysis that needs to be done. So in non-repeated we distinguish conituous and categorical values and for repeated measures we will investigate for each of the types which is the most valueble approach to get the ouput as useful as possible.

### Exposing results
When you run the upload it will not show the summary statistics and it will push them directly into the catalogue. 

## Output
When the results are pushed to the catalogue we first create a PDF to distribute the output to the cohorts. You can display the through specifying `verbose = TRUE`.
