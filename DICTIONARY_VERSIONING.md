# Dictionary and data versioning in Opal table names

There are 2 kinds of versioning in the LifeCycle project.

First of all the data dictionary versioning and second the versioning of the data itself. We are using an implementation of semantic versioning ([semantic versioning](https://semver.org)). A better explanation on using semantic versioning in data can be found here: [semantic versioning for data products](https://medium.com/data-architect/semantic-versioning-for-data-products-2b060962093).

## Versioning
We now can distinguish 3 tables for the core-variables and the variables harmonized in WP3.
* non repeated measures
* monthly repeated measures
* yearly repeated measures

The version-scheme is as follows:

**dictionary-major . dictionary-minor . cohort . data-major . data-minor . tablename**

*Examples*
* 1_1_core_dnbc_1_0_non_repeated_measures.xlsx
* 1_1_core_dnbc_1_0_monthly_repeated_measures.xlsx
* 1_1_core_dnbc_1_0_yearly_repeated_measures.xlsx

*Table names*
* 1_1_core_dnbc_1_0_non_repeated_measures
* 1_1_core_dnbc_1_0_monthly_repeated_measures
* 1_1_core_dnbc_1_0_yearly_repeated_measuress

### Dictionary
We are using semantic versioning in the data dictionary in LifeCycle. The implementation we now use is:

* **Major**
  * Remove columns from the existing tables
* **Minor**
  * Add additional columns to the existing tables
  * Renaming of columns within the exisiting tables (the original column remains in the set)

### Data
Not only the dictionary has to have a version also the data is versioned within LifeCycle. This is needed because of the reproducability of the research that is going to be performed on the datasets.

The implementation of semantic versioning is as follows.
* **Major**
  * Amending your dataset with new data
* **Minor**
  * Correcting errors in the data (e.g. categories which are encoded the wrong way)

## Changelog
To keep track of all the changed within the different versions of the dictionaries and data releases we need to have changelogs. This way we can trace back what has happened in which release.

### Dictionary releases
Check: [dictionary changelog](./changelogs/DICTIONARY_CHANGELOG.md)

### Data releases
We do not have a cohort specific changelog at the moment. Coming soon.
